I want to showcase what I've learned in R and bioinformatics. This repository will serve that purpose. All small projects which are involved in furthering my knowledge will be posted here. Bigger projects will have their own repositories.

- RNA to Amino Acid Project:
- The purpose of this project was to learn how to create a function in R. It takes an RNA sequence as the argument and makes sure it is compatible for conversion. It checks; character length, whitespace, divisible by 3, no unknown bases, correct bases present (AUCG), and that only valid codons are present. After these checks the sequence is converted into a string which contains the amino acid sequence. The output of this function can be assigned to a vector to be used later is necessary...
- What I have learned with this project: How to create a function. How to perform checks to prevent errors. How to use basic regular expression. Finally how to manipulate strings.
